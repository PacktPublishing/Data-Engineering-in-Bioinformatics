# Data-Engineering-in-Bioinformatics: Chapter 2

This directory contains code examples from Chapter 2 of the book "Data Engineering in Bioinformatics", published by Packt.

## Description

Chapter 2 covers the basics of data acquisition, including how to download data from the internet and how to read data from files. The code examples in this directory demonstrate how to use Python to download data from the internet and read data from various file formats.

## Contents

The directory contains the following files:

- `data_extraction.py`: A Python script that extracts the data from the source for each one of the datasets to use throughout and saves it to a file.
- `data_loading.py`: A Python script that loasd the data to the corresponding data solution in the cloud.
- `data_transformation.py`: A Python script that reads data from a file for each of the datasets and transforms it.


## Requirements

To run the code examples in this directory, you will need the following:

- Python 3
- The Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the code examples in this directory, simply run the Python script you are interested in. Each script demonstrates a different data acquisition technique.
